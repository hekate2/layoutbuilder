# Hekate's Website Builder!!
Last Updated: 04-16-2025

## Description
This is a webpage builder (that I wrote a while ago) that uses a GUI to
allow users to resize squares to build a website layout, which they
can later host by themselves.

## Limitations
- No webpage upload (so can only have one active editing 'session')
- uses absolute positioning and fixed sizes so unless you use it in
a very deliberate way you're site is not responsive.
